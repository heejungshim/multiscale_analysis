better.effect.size.R 
   - let's work on how to estimate effect size better for simulation!
   - generate raw data, genotype data (70, 30, and 10 individuals), smooth.ratio (effect size)
   - also plot effect size
try.different.effect.size.R
   - let's try different ways to get effect sizes

get.pval.wave.R 
   - collect pvalue from wave output files, make a list, and save R object.
get.pval.ms.R 
   - collect pvalue from multiscale output files, make a list, and save R object.
see.pval.R 
   - make histogram and roc curves from results
 
get.logLR.wave.R 
   - collect logLR from wave output files, make a list, and save R object.
get.logLR.ms.R 
   - collect logLR from multiscale output files, make a list, and save R object.
see.logLR.R 
   - make histogram and roc curves from results


see.pval.over.R 
  - make ROC curves to compare overdispersion effect
see.logLR.over.R
  - make ROC curves to compare overdispersion effect

see.pval.RD.R 
 - make ROC curves to see effects of different read depth
see.logLR.RD.R
 - make ROC curves to see effects of different read depth 

see.logLR.RD.4ind.R
 - make histogram 
 - make ROC curves to see effects of differnt read depth for 4 individuals. 

see.logLR.RD.10ind.R
 - make histogram 
 - make ROC curves to see effects of differnt read depth for 10 individuals. 

see.logLR.RD.6ind.R
 - make histogram 
 - make ROC curves to see effects of differnt read depth for 6 individuals. 

compute.AUROC.R
 -  compute area under roc curves for different sample sizes and library read depths to visualize results better.
