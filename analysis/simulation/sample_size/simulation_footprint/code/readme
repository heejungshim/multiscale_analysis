better.effect.size.R 
   - let's work on how to estimate effect size better for simulation!
   - generate raw data, genotype data (70, 30, and 10 individuals), smooth.ratio (effect size)
   - also plot effect size
get.pval.wave.R 
   - collect pvalue from wave output files, make a list, and save R object.
get.pval.ms.R 
   - collect pvalue from multiscale output files, make a list, and save R object.
see.pval.R 
   - make histogram and roc curves from results
