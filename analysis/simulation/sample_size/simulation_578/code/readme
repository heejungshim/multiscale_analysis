get.pval.R 
  - get pvalues from the analysis and save them as Robject
  - modify "getpval.sim.578.R" from /mnt/lustre/home/shim/wavelets/revision/code/ 
see.pval.R 
  - 1. check the distribution of p-values under the null
check.numberOfperm.R
  - to check if different numbers of permuation (1000 vs 10000) result in similar results
  - modify wavelets/revision/code/check.numberOfperm.R (for wavelets and window based approah, I got consistent results)
