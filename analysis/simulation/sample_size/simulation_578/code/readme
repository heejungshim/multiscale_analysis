check.numberOfperm.R
  - to check if different numbers of permuation (1000 vs 10000) result in similar results
  - modify wavelets/revision/code/check.numberOfperm.R (for wavelets and window based approah, I got consistent results)
fillin.missing.genoIX.R 
  - there are three dsQTLs without genoIX information. Try to fill in those information.  
prepare.data.for.simulation.R
  - for simulation, prepare raw data and effect size for each dsQTL.
  - modify /mnt/lustre/home/shim/wavelets/revision/code/simulation.explore.578.sites.R 
        and /mnt/lustre/home/shim/multiscale_analysis/analysis/simulation/sample_size/simulation_footprint/code/better.effect.size.R
make.effect.size.fig.R
  - get effect sizes from 578 dsQTLs, idetinfied by Shim and Stephens 2014 (see its Supplementary Materials for details of those dsQTLs) and make effect size figures to investigate their patterns.

get.pval.wave.R
   - collect pvalue from wave output files, make a list, and save R object.
get.pval.ms.R
   - collect pvalue from multiscale output files, make a list, and save R object.
see.pval.R
   - make histogram and roc curves from results

get.logLR.wave.R
   - collect logLR from wave output files, make a list, and save R object.
get.logLR.ms.R
   - collect logLR from multiscale output files, make a list, and save R object.
see.logLR.R
   - make histogram and roc curves from results

## use this after running get.pval.XX.R or get.logLR.XX.R to see if we have all results
sum(done_list_alt[[1]])
sum(done_list_alt[[2]])
sum(done_list_alt[[3]])
sum(done_list_alt[[4]])
sum(done_list_null[[1]])
sum(done_list_null[[2]])
sum(done_list_null[[3]])
sum(done_list_null[[4]])

see.pval.over.R 
  - make histogram and roc curves to see effects of different overdispersion parameters on performances of two methods. 
see.logLR.over.R
  - make histogram and roc curves to see effects of different overdispersion parameters on performances of two methods. 

see.pval.RD.R 
  - make histogram and roc curves to see effects of different library read depths on performances of two methods. 
see.logLR.RD.R
  - make histogram and roc curves to see effects of different library read depths on performances of two methods. 

see.pval.RD.4.R 
  - same as see.pval.RD.R, but consider four library read depths 
see.logLR.RD.4.R 
  - same as see.logLR.RD.R, but consider four library read depths
